Installation
============


The recommended method of installation is to use the Python package manager |pip|_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install aiidalab-qe-hp

This will install the latest stable version that was released to PyPI.

To install the package from source, first clone the repository and then install using |pip|_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/superstar54/aiidalab-qe-hp
    $ pip install -e aiidalab-qe-hp

The ``-e`` flag will install the package in editable mode, meaning that changes to the source code will be automatically picked up.



.. |pip| replace:: ``pip``
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
